# :wave: Hey, I am Aditya

I am a 24 year old Software Engineer living in Stony Brook, New York. I'm currently a master's student at Stony Brook University. I used to work at https://github.com/navana-tech as a Software Engineer. I co-maintain https://github.com/android-password-store/ which I use personally on a daily basis. I've recently started blogging at [skrilltrax.dev](https://skrilltrax.dev) to share all the knowledge that I've gained over the past few years. 

I love chatting and meeting new people so if you ever wanna get in touch drop me a message on any of the platforms mentioned below. Have a nice day!
